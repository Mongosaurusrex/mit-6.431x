Let say that you have:
- 4 shirts
- 3 ties
- 2 jackets
What is the total combination of attires?
$$
4 * 3 * 2 = 24
$$

Generalization:
- $r$ stages
- $n_i$ choices at stage i
$$
n_1 * n_2 * n_3 * \dots * n_i
$$
## Examples
- Number of license plates with 2 letters followed by 3 digits:
$$
26*26*10*10*10 = 676000
$$
	- ... if repetition is prohibited:
	  $$
	  26*25* 10*9*8=468000
	  $$

- Permutations: Number of ways of ordering n elements:
  $$
  n*(n-1)*(n-2)*\dots*1 = n!
  $$
- Number of subsets of ${1, \dots ,n}$:
$$
2*2*2*\dots*2 = 2^n
$$
