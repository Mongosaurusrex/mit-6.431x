Sample space: $\{1,2,...\}$ 
We are given $P(n) = \frac{1}{2^n},\ n=1,2...$

$P(\{2,4,6,...\})=P(\{2\} \cup ,\{4\} \cup,\{6\} \cup, ...\}) = P(2)+P(4)+P(6)...$   

### Countable Additivity Axiom
If $A_1, A_2, A_3, ...$ is an infinite *sequence* of *disjoint events*, then $P(A_1\cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup ...) = P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)+...$  

- Additivity holds only for "countable" sequences of events
- The unit square (similarly the real line, etc) is *not countable* (its elements cannot be arranged in a sequence)
- The "Area" is a legitimate probability law on the unit square, as long as we do not try to assign probabilities/areas to "very strange" sets
