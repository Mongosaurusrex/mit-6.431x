### Sequence definition
A sequence is nothing but a collection of elements coming out of some set, and are indexed: $a_1, a_2, a_3,...$

Does a sequence converge to a specific number a:
$$a_i -> a <=> \lim_{i->\infty}{a_i} = a$$    ![[Pasted image 20240908163619.png]]

### When does a sequence converge?
If $a_i \leq a_1 +1$ for all i then either:
- The sequence "converges to $\infty$"
- The sequence converges to some real number $a$ 

If $|a_i - a| \leq b_i$, for all i, and $b_i -> 0$ then $a_i -> a$
