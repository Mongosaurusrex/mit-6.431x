Two rolls of a tetrahedra die
Let every possible outcome have probability 1/16
$P(X=1)=4*\frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{4}$ 

$Let\ Z=min(X,Y)$
$x=2,\ y=3,\ z=2$
$P(Z=4) = \frac{1}{16}$
$P(Z=2)=\frac{5}{16}$

| Y/X | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4   | X=1 | Z=2 |     | Z=4 |
| 3   | X=1 | Z=2 |     |     |
| 2   | X=1 | Z=2 | Z=2 | Z=2 |
| 1   | X=1 |     |     |     |

## Discrete uniform law
Assume that $\Omega$ consists of n equally likely elements
Assume A consists of k elements

Then $P(A) = k * \frac{1}{n}$
