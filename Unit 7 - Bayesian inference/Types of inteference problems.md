Hypothesis testing and estimation are two key approaches in statistical inference, each with distinct purposes:

1. **Hypothesis Testing**:

• Hypothesis testing is about evaluating whether a certain assumption (hypothesis) about a population parameter is likely true based on sample data.

• It involves defining a null hypothesis ($H_0$) and an alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) and then determining whether there is enough evidence in the data to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$ .

• The outcome is typically a p-value, which quantifies the strength of the evidence against .

• Examples: Testing whether the mean of a population is equal to a specific value or whether two population means are equal.

2. **Estimation Testing (or simply Estimation)**:

• Estimation focuses on approximating the value of a population parameter (such as a mean, proportion, or standard deviation) using sample data.

• Estimation methods can be **point estimates** (a single value estimate, like a sample mean) or **interval estimates** (such as confidence intervals, which provide a range within which the parameter likely falls).

• Estimation does not test a hypothesis but instead gives a best guess (with some level of confidence) for the parameter’s value.

• Examples: Estimating the average income in a city or the proportion of people who prefer a particular product.

  

In short, hypothesis testing assesses whether a claim about a population is supported by the data, while estimation provides a measure of what the parameter’s actual value is based on the data.
