The overall expected value of a random variable  X  can be found by first figuring out its expected value in different scenarios (or “conditions”), and then averaging those expected values, weighted by how likely each scenario is.

Mathematically, if  Y  is another random variable that breaks the situation into different conditions, the theorem says:
$$E[X] = E[E[X | Y]]$$

$$
E[X]=P(A_1)E[X|A_1]+P(A_2)E[X|A_2]+P(A_3)E[X|A_3]
$$
This means:
1.	First, you find the expected value of  X , assuming you know what  Y  is (this is the conditional expectation  $E[X | Y]$ ).
2.	Then, you average these conditional expectations over all possible values of  Y , considering how likely each value of  Y  is.

## Example

Imagine you have a company with two departments: Department A and Department B. The average salary  X  in each department is different, and the number of people in each department also varies. You want to know the overall average salary across the entire company.

•	First, you find the average salary within each department (the conditional expectation).
•	Then, you combine those averages based on how many people are in each department (weighting them by probability).

This gives you the total average salary across the company, which is the expected value of  X . The Total Expectation Theorem ensures that this method works consistently.
