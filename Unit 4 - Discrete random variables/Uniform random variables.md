A uniform random variable is one that has an equal chance of taking any value within a certain range. Think of it like rolling a fair die: each number (1 to 6) has an equal probability of appearing.

**Key Points:**

1. **Definition:** A uniform random variable means every outcome in a given range is equally likely. For example, if you pick a random number between 1 and 10, each number from 1 to 10 has the same chance of being chosen.

2. **Continuous vs. Discrete:**

	• **Discrete Uniform Variable:** Think of a fair die roll. The variable can only take specific values (1, 2, 3, etc.), and each value has the same probability.

	• **Continuous Uniform Variable:** Imagine picking any random point on a line between 0 and 1. Every point on that line is equally likely, making it a “continuous” range.

3. **Probability Density Function (PDF):** For continuous uniform variables, the PDF is a flat line, showing equal probability across the range. For example, if the range is from 0 to 1, the probability density is constant across that interval.

4. **Example:**

	• **Discrete:** Rolling a die—each number (1 to 6) has a probability of 1/6.

	• **Continuous:** Randomly picking a number between 0 and 10—each number within this interval is equally likely, so the probability is evenly spread.

  

In simple terms, a uniform random variable is just a fancy way of saying every outcome in a set range is equally possible!
