- Is the "probability law" or "probability distribution" of X
![[Pasted image 20240924182852.png]]
- If we fix some x, then "X=x" is an event

$$
x=5, X=5, \{\omega:X(\omega) = 5\}=\{a,b\}
$$
$$
p_X(5)=1/2
$$
Furthermore:
$$
p_X(x) = P(X=x)
$$

### Revisit the old tetrahedral die

X = First roll
Y = Second roll
Lets assume every possible outcome have probability 1/16

Z = X + Y

| Y/X | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
$$
p_Z(2)=P(Z=2) = 1/16
$$
$$
p_Z(3)=P(Z=3)=2/16
$$
$$
p_Z(4)=3/16
$$
$$
p_Z(5)=4/16
$$
$$
p_Z(6)=3/16
$$
$$
p_Z(7)=2/16
$$
$$
p_Z(8)=1/16
$$
