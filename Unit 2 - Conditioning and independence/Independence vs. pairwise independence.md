- Two independent fair coin tosses
	- $H_1$: First toss is H
	- $H_2$: Second toss is H
$$
P(H_1)=P(H_2)=1/2
$$
$$
P(H_1 \cap H_2)=1/4
$$
- C: The two tosses had the same result
$$
P(H_1\cap C)=P(H_1\cap H_2) = 1/4, P(H_1)P(C) = 1/2*1/2 = 1/4
$$
$$
P(H_1\cap H_2 \cap C) = P(HH) = 1/4
$$
$$
P(H_1)P(H_2)P(C) = 1/8
$$
$H_1, H_2, C$ are pairwise independent, but not independent
