A Normal (or Gaussian) random variable is a continuous random variable that follows a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution.
 The probability density function (PDF) of a Normal distribution is given by:$$
N(0,1):f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}
$$This distribution is fundamental in statistics and probability because it naturally arises in many real-world processes, especially when there are numerous small, independent factors that add up to produce an outcome (by the Central Limit Theorem).

$$
E[X]=0
$$
$$
var(X)=1
$$

## General normal random variables
$$
N(\mu,\sigma^2): f_X(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$
$$
E[X]=\mu
$$
$$
var(X)=\sigma^2
$$
## Linear functions of a normal random variable
$$
Let\ Y =aX+b, X = N(\mu,\sigma^2)
$$
$$
E[Y]=a\mu+b
$$
$$
var(Y)
